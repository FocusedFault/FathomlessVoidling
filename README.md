**FEEDBACK FORM [HERE](https://forms.gle/Hr8LDYBE7HZ8aF6w9)**

## Info

- Your run ends after Voidling dies (will be fixed next update - probably)
- Voidling has the stats of an alt final boss not a loop boss currently (fight after mithrix)
- You cannot attack Voidling's main body just the joints
- There's no config (for now)
- Voidling doesn't take damage at the healthbar points until he phase transitions (check phase info below)
- Small Voidling's attacks are changed as well (in case you spawn them in using debugtoolkit/aerolt)
- Attacks might change for the 1.0 (adding/swapping)
- This mod is currently held together with duct tape but I wanted to get feedback while I take a break from it

## Known Issues

- In multiplayer, non-hosts can't see or damage joints
- Phase 1 attacks can be interrupted by joint breaks
- Music repeats at the end
- If you have a ton of damage you can perma stun lock him by breaking joints and making him fall constantly
- Run ends after big voidling dies
